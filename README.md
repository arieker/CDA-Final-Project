## Computer Logic & Organization Final Project

In this project, you are asked to write the core part of a mini processor simulator called MySPIM
using the C programming language on a Unix platform. Your MySPIM will demonstrate functions
of the MIPS processor as well as the principle actions of the datapath and the control signals of a
MIPS processor. The simulator should read in a file containing MIPS machine codes (in the
format specified below) and simulate what the MIPS processor does cycle-by-cycle. You are
required to implement the processor simulation as a single-cycle datapath. You are asked to fill
in the body of several functions in the provided project file.
